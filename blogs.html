            <p>When was the last time you got a full health checkup?</p>

            <p>If you're like most people, you probably can't remember. We schedule everything else—dentist appointments, car maintenance, even haircuts—but somehow our own health screenings get pushed to "next year."</p>

            <p>Here's the truth: <strong>Annual medical tests aren't just for sick people.</strong> They're how you catch problems BEFORE they become serious. Think of them as your body's early warning system.</p>

            <p>Let's talk about the 5 essential tests every adult should do annually—and why they matter more than you think.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Why Annual Screenings Matter</h2>

            <p>Most serious health conditions don't announce themselves with symptoms. High cholesterol doesn't hurt. Prediabetes feels like nothing. Early-stage problems are silent—until they're not.</p>

            <p><strong>Annual screenings help you:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Catch diseases early when they're easiest to treat</li>
                <li>Establish your "normal" baseline for comparison</li>
                <li>Make informed decisions about your health</li>
                <li>Save money (prevention is cheaper than treatment)</li>
                <li>Get peace of mind</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now let's get into the specific tests you need.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>1. Complete Blood Count (CBC)</h2>

            <p><strong>What it tests:</strong> Your blood cells—red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detects anemia (low red blood cells = chronic fatigue)</li>
                <li>Identifies infections or immune system issues</li>
                <li>Spots blood disorders early</li>
                <li>Reveals inflammation in your body</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>What to know:</strong> This is one of the most informative tests you can do. Abnormal results don't always mean something serious, but they give your doctor critical clues about what's happening inside your body.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Red flags to watch for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Constant fatigue despite good sleep</li>
                <li>Frequent infections</li>
                <li>Unexplained bruising</li>
                <li>Dizziness or weakness</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>2. Lipid Profile (Cholesterol Test)</h2>

            <p><strong>What it tests:</strong> Your cholesterol levels—total cholesterol, LDL ("bad"), HDL ("good"), and triglycerides.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> High cholesterol is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. The scary part? You won't feel it until something serious happens.</p>

            <p><strong>What your numbers mean:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Cholesterol:</strong> Should be under 200 mg/dL</li>
                <li><strong>LDL (bad cholesterol):</strong> Under 100 mg/dL is ideal</li>
                <li><strong>HDL (good cholesterol):</strong> Higher is better (above 40 for men, 50 for women)</li>
                <li><strong>Triglycerides:</strong> Under 150 mg/dL</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Who needs this most:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone over 35</li>
                <li>People with family history of heart disease</li>
                <li>Those with obesity, diabetes, or high blood pressure</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Good news:</strong> High cholesterol is often fixable with diet, exercise, and sometimes medication. But you have to know it's high first.</p>
            </div>

            <hr>

            <h2>3. Blood Sugar Test (Fasting Glucose or HbA1c)</h2>

            <p><strong>What it tests:</strong> Your blood sugar levels and how well your body processes glucose.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Diabetes and prediabetes affect millions of adults—many don't even know they have it. Left unchecked, high blood sugar damages your heart, kidneys, nerves, and eyes.</p>

            <p><strong>Types of tests:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fasting Blood Sugar:</strong> Measures glucose after 8-12 hours without eating</li>
                <li><strong>HbA1c:</strong> Shows your average blood sugar over 3 months (more reliable)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What your numbers mean:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Fasting glucose under 100 mg/dL</li>
                <li><strong>Prediabetic:</strong> 100-125 mg/dL</li>
                <li><strong>Diabetic:</strong> 126 mg/dL or higher</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>The good part:</strong> Prediabetes is reversible with lifestyle changes. Catching it early gives you time to act.</p>
            </div>

            <hr>

            <h2>4. Kidney Function Test (Creatinine & BUN)</h2>

            <p><strong>What it tests:</strong> How well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your kidneys are silent workers—they don't complain until they're seriously damaged. By the time symptoms appear (swelling, fatigue, changes in urination), kidney disease may already be advanced.</p>

            <p><strong>What gets tested:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creatinine:</strong> High levels = kidneys aren't filtering properly</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):</strong> Elevated = potential kidney issues or dehydration</li>
                <li><strong>Urinalysis:</strong> Checks for protein or blood in urine (early warning signs)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Who needs this most:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>People with diabetes or high blood pressure</li>
                <li>Those with family history of kidney disease</li>
                <li>Anyone taking long-term medications (painkillers, certain antibiotics)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Prevention tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay hydrated</li>
                <li>Limit NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin) overuse</li>
                <li>Control blood pressure and blood sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>5. Liver Function Test (LFT)</h2>

            <p><strong>What it tests:</strong> Enzymes and proteins that show how well your liver is working.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your liver is your body's detox center. It processes everything you eat, drink, and absorb—including medications and alcohol. Liver problems often show no symptoms until significant damage has occurred.</p>

            <p><strong>What gets measured:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ALT & AST:</strong> Enzymes that spike when liver is damaged</li>
                <li><strong>ALP:</strong> Indicates bile duct issues</li>
                <li><strong>Bilirubin:</strong> High levels cause jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes)</li>
                <li><strong>Albumin:</strong> Protein levels (low = liver isn't functioning well)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Fatty liver disease is epidemic—and most people don't know they have it. This test catches it early.</p>
            </div>

            <hr>

            <h2>Bonus Tests (Based on Age/Gender)</h2>

            <h3>For Women:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pap smear</strong> (cervical cancer screening) - every 3 years, ages 21-65</li>
                <li><strong>Mammogram</strong> (breast cancer screening) - annually starting at 40</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Men:</h3>
            <ul>

            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>How to Prepare for Your Tests</h2>

                <li>Get good sleep</li>

            </div>

            <hr>
